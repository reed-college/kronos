This will take in google calendars and icals for proffessors and the determine what times they are free during orals week.
There will be an interface to see what proffessors under certain departments or other criteria are free at a certain time.
Also it will be able to tell what times some amount of proffessors are all free. 
There should be a way to for someone(FAC or Student, idk) to schedule a proffessor for a oral and make them no longer show up as available during that time
